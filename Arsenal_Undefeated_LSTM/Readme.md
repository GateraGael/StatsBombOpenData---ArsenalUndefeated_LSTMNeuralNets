# ArsenalUndefeated_LSTMNeuralNets

Created a few LSTM sequence to sequence classifiers using StatsBomb Open Data on Arsenal Undefeated Season.
I have been an Arsenal fan for longtime and naturally I chose to find the data that took me back to long lost glory days.
So far I created an LSTM Binary Sequence to Sequence model prediction that attempts at taking a previous match week results to predict either a win or a draw.
