# StatsBombOpenData


Took StatsBomb's Introduction to Football Analytics course available at the StatsBomb Academy link: [StatsBomb Academy](https://statsbomb.com/academy/)
Prompted me to learn a bit more about the company and found the github repository to Data they chose to open source.
Link: [StatsBomb OpenData Github](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data)

Will be doing random exploration of their open source data sets either in Python or other language.

Certification of completion:
