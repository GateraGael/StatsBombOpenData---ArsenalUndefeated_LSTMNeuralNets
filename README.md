# StatsBombOpenData

Created a few LSTM sequence to sequence classifiers using StatsBomb Open Data on Arsenal Undefeated Season.
Taking StatsBomb's Introduction to Football Analytics course available at the StatsBomb Academy link: [StatsBomb Academy](https://statsbomb.com/academy/)

Truly enjoyed the course and obtained a certification of completion:

Prompted me to learn a bit more about the company and found the github repository to Data they chose to open source.
